Hi well, I'm Carlos Baeza and in this
video we will talk

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.103
about the disease of
Bronchitis.

00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:08.880
Well, bronchitis is inflammation

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.199
of the bronchial ducts the airways
respiratory

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:16.016
that carries oxygen in its lungs,
this causes a cough that forms

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:20.016
often has mucus too
causes shortness of breath

00:00:20.016 --> 00:00:22.786
gasping and chest pressure

00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:24.846
there are two types of bronchitis:

00:00:24.846 --> 00:00:28.210
acute bronchitis and
chronic bronchitis.

00:00:30.542 --> 00:00:35.962
For the prevention of this disease
we have a series of tips such as:

00:00:35.962 --> 00:00:39.041
avoid contact with people
who have the flu or another

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:43.041
respiratory illness, wash your
hands frequently

00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:47.141
or use alcohol-based disinfectant,
avoid touching your eyes

00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:51.141
nose or mouth and getting vaccinated
every year against the flu.

00:00:52.973 --> 00:00:54.493
Well this disease has

00:00:54.493 --> 00:00:56.633
a series of symptoms such as:

00:00:56.802 --> 00:01:00.802
complication in
breathing, may present

00:01:01.637 --> 00:01:05.637
the appearance of cough or also
may appear

00:01:05.637 --> 00:01:07.934
low-grade fever and fever.

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:14.249
good for treatment in most
cases of acute bronchitis

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:17.545
get better without treatment and generally

00:01:17.606 --> 00:01:19.269
after a couple of weeks.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.181
And with this we conclude the video.
